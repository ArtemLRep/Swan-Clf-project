# Swan-Clf-project
<h1> Project description </h1>
          <p> This model is for <a href="https://hacks-ai.ru/hackathons.html?eventId=969064&caseEl=969235&tab=1" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>,
              organized by Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Russia. The task is to train Neural network to
              classify 3 types of rare swans: Whooper(Klikun in Russian transcription), Mute(Shipun) and Tundra swan(Malyi). The dataset consists of
              images, and masks. I used pretrained resnet34 model with FC classifier. Two last layers of resnet34, and FC classifier were trained.
              Accuracy on test sample was 89.3%

              Also, I trained my own resnet model and a simple convolutional model. But their accuracies were lower.
